# Romance & Investment Scam Red Flags

These scams build emotional trust — then exploit it to steal money, crypto, or personal information.  
They can last days, weeks, or even months before the final financial hook appears.

## How the Scam Works

1. Scammer meets the victim via dating apps, social media, or messaging platforms  
2. Builds emotional connection quickly — flattery, daily messages, fabricated life stories  
3. Introduces investment opportunity (usually crypto) or claims they need urgent financial help  
4. Victim is persuaded to send money, crypto, or gift cards  
5. The scammer disappears — or keeps asking for more, promising love or profit

## Common Variants

- **Crypto love scams**: They convince victims to “invest” using a fake trading app  
- **Emergency scams**: Scammer claims they’re stuck overseas and need help  
- **Inheritance scams**: Fake legal claims that require upfront fees  
- **Pig butchering**: Long-term relationship grooming ending in major financial loss

## Why It Works

- Exploits loneliness or vulnerability  
- Creates trust through shared interests and fake backstories  
- Uses time pressure — “limited-time crypto trade” or “emergency medical bill”  
- Often impersonates real people (stolen photos, fake credentials)  
- Victims are emotionally invested, which overrides logical red flags

## Real-World Example

A woman meets a man via Instagram. He’s kind, wealthy, and “cares deeply.”  
He shares screenshots of his crypto gains and convinces her to join.  
She downloads an app he recommends and deposits $1,000.  
The app shows returns — but when she tries to withdraw, she’s told to deposit more.  
Eventually, she loses over $20,000 and never hears from him again.

# How to Spot a Fake Banking App

Fake mobile apps impersonating banks or financial platforms are a growing threat — especially on Android devices.  
These apps often look and feel real but are designed to steal your login credentials, intercept SMS codes, or hijack payments.

This post breaks down how these apps work, how to identify them, and what to do if you’ve installed one.

## How Do Fake Banking Apps Work?

Fake apps are typically distributed through:

- **Third-party app stores**
- **Links in SMS messages or emails**
- **QR codes on phishing sites**
- **Social media ads targeting your location or interests**

Once installed, they may:

- Display a **realistic login screen** to steal credentials  
- Run silently and forward your **MFA codes or SMS messages**  
- Request dangerous permissions (e.g., accessibility, SMS, contacts)  
- Overlay the real banking app to **intercept logins in real time**

## Real-World Example

A user receives an SMS saying:

> "Important: Your NAB banking app requires an urgent security update. Tap here to install."

The link downloads an `.apk` file (Android only) that looks like NAB’s real app — same icon, same colors.  
After login, the credentials are silently sent to the attacker’s server.

The user sees an error and thinks it failed — meanwhile, the attacker logs in with the stolen details.

## Red Flags to Watch For

- The app was installed **from a link, not the Play Store**  
- It requests **unusual permissions** (e.g., SMS, accessibility)  
- The app doesn’t update through Google Play  
- You get SMS messages like "Your verification code is: 937492" unexpectedly  
- It shows **login errors** repeatedly or forwards you to your real app afterward

## Prevention Tips

- ✅ Only install banking apps from **official app stores** (Google Play, Apple App Store)  
- ✅ Check **developer name** and **number of downloads**  
- ✅ Never install `.apk` files manually unless you're 100% sure  
- ✅ Review app permissions — never allow SMS or accessibility to financial apps  
- ✅ Enable Google Play Protect and keep your OS updated  
- ✅ Use biometrics and bank app security features

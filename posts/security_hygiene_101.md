# Security Hygiene 101 — The Digital Basics Everyone Forgets

Cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and threat feeds. 
It’s also about everyday habits — the kind that **quietly protect you every single day**.

Here’s a no-nonsense guide to basic digital hygiene that everyone — from interns to executives — should follow.

## 1. Don’t Reuse Passwords

Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is **the #1 way people get hacked**.

If one site gets breached, attackers test the same credentials on:
- Email accounts
- Social media
- Banking apps
- Work logins

✅ **Fix it:**
- Use a **password manager** (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass)
- Store **unique, strong passwords** for every site

---

## 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Passwords alone are not enough anymore.

Use an authenticator app like:
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Google Authenticator
- Authy

Enable MFA for:
- Email
- Banking
- Work portals
- Password managers themselves

Avoid SMS if possible — it’s better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swaps.

## 3. Regularly Check and Clean Your Devices

Run security updates on:
- Phones
- Browsers
- Operating systems

Uninstall unused software, especially browser extensions 
Run periodic scans with:
- Windows Defender
- Malwarebytes
- ESET or another reputable tool

---

## 4. Secure Your Browser and Email

| Hygiene Tip                  | What to Do                                        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Disable unused extensions | Especially anything with full page access         |
| Watch for auto-downloads  | Turn off “open files automatically” in browsers   |
| Turn off external image loading | Stops tracking pixels and malicious content |
| Use bookmarks for critical logins | Prevents mistyped phishing URLs            |

---

## 5. Lock Down Your Phone

- Use **biometrics or PIN** — not just swipe 
- Disable app install from unknown sources 
- Turn off Bluetooth when not in use 
- Audit app permissions (does a calculator need location access?)

Your phone is your 2FA device, wallet, and communication hub — protect it like your laptop.

---

## 6. Think Before You Click

A few second pause saves hours of incident cleanup.

✅ Hover over links  
✅ Ask: “Was I expecting this?”  
✅ Don’t download random invoices or resumes  
✅ Don’t scan QR codes in suspicious emails or posters

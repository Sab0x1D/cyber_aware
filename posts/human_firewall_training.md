# Building a Human Firewall: Security Training for Non-Tech Staff

You can invest millions in firewalls, SIEMs, and EDR tools… 
But all it takes is **one employee clicking a malicious link** to open the door.

That’s why **your people ARE your perimeter** — and they need to be trained like it.

## What Is a Human Firewall?

A “human firewall” is a workforce that:
- Recognizes phishing attempts
- Questions suspicious links or requests
- Reports potential threats early
- Follows security hygiene without being told every time

✅ It’s not about turning staff into security pros  
✅ It’s about giving them **repeatable instincts** to catch the obvious threats

## Top 5 Threats to Train Against

| Threat Type         | Common Vector                  | What to Teach                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Phishing Emails  | Email with links/attachments  | Hover before clicking, spot red flags |
| Smishing & Vishing | Fake SMS or phone calls        | Don’t trust urgent messages or unknown callers |
| Infected Files    | Malicious invoices or resumes | Don’t open unsolicited attachments   |
| Social Engineering | Impersonation of IT, HR, etc. | Always verify identity independently |
| Fake Login Portals | Cloned websites via link or QR | Go to known URLs, not email links    |

---

## What Effective Training Looks Like

Keep it short 

Use real examples 

Repeat it often

**Formats that work:**
- 5-minute “Threat of the Month” videos 
- Monthly phishing simulations 
- Slack/email security tips (“This Week in Threats”) 
- Internal phishing leaderboard (gamify it) 
- Security standups in company-wide meetings

---

## Use Language That Clicks

Avoid: 
> “Ensure all users comply with the enterprise data protection strategy to mitigate exfiltration threats.”

Try: 
> “If it feels sketchy, slow down. Hover over links. When in doubt, ask IT — we won’t shame you.”

Speak in plain English. Use analogies. 
→ “Would you give your house keys to a stranger on the street? Then don’t give your login to a pop-up.”

## Campaign Themes You Can Reuse

| Theme Name          | Description                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| "Don’t Hold the Door" | Tailgating awareness (physical security)  |
| "MFA Saves the Day"    | Explaining 2FA with real-life scenarios   |
| "That Link’s Lying"   | Spotting phishing attempts visually       |
| "Trust, but Verify"   | Challenge social engineering attempts     |
| "Secure Your Inbox"   | Cleaning up old forwarding rules & shared inboxes |

---

## Smart Training ≠ Shame

When someone clicks a phishing link:
- Thank them for **reporting it**
- Use it as a **teachable moment**
- Don’t isolate or embarrass them

Security culture = trust + support + learning loops

---

## TL;DR: Building a Human Firewall

- [ ] Train with **real examples**, not abstract concepts 
- [ ] Use **short, visual, repeatable** formats 
- [ ] Reinforce trust — no shame, only growth 
- [ ] Focus on top 5 threats (phishing, social engineering, etc.) 
- [ ] Encourage **slow down + verify** instincts 
- [ ] Build a culture where security is **everyone’s job**

People are your **first responders** — give them the tools, not just the tech.

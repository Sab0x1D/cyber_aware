# Smishing Examples & Response Guide

Smishing (SMS phishing) is one of the most common and effective scams today.  
Attackers exploit trust, urgency, and mobile habits to steal credentials, install malware, or harvest payment info.

This post breaks down real-world examples, explains the tactics used, and provides practical guidance on how to spot and respond to them.

## What Is Smishing?

Smishing is short for **SMS phishing** — fraudulent messages designed to trick you into:

- Clicking on malicious links  
- Entering credentials into fake websites  
- Downloading malicious mobile apps  
- Calling fake support numbers  

Unlike email phishing, smishing exploits **trust in mobile messaging** — especially since many people read and act quickly on phones.

## Common Smishing Scenarios

### 1. **Parcel Delivery Notifications**

> “Your package is waiting. Reschedule delivery here: [bit.ly/track-delivery]”

Looks like Australia Post, UPS, DHL, or FedEx.  
Link leads to a fake login or payment request to “release” the item.

### 2. **Bank Account Alerts**

> “ANZ: Your account is temporarily locked. Tap to verify now.”

Uses urgency and fake branding.  
Landing page often mirrors real bank login portals.

### 3. **Mobile Carrier Messages**

> “Telstra: Your recent bill was unpaid. View details here: [short.link]”

If clicked, may lead to malware-laced APK or ask for payment.

### 4. **Fake MFA/Verification Codes**

> “Your verification code is 294842. Don’t share this with anyone.”

You didn’t request this?  
It may be a login attempt — someone is trying to reset your password or access your account.

## How to Respond

- **Pause before tapping** — especially shortened links  
- **Don’t reply** to unknown SMS senders, even to say “STOP”  
- **Avoid downloading apps** from links sent via SMS — use the app store  
- **Contact the real service provider** through official channels  
- **Report smishing** to your mobile provider or national scam reporting portal  
  - Example (AU): forward to *7226 (SCAM)*

# Subscription Renewal Scams — “Your Norton Is Expiring”

These scams prey on fear and urgency by faking antivirus or software renewal notices.  
They often target non-technical users through emails, popups, or even phone calls pretending to be customer support.

## How the Scam Works

A typical message looks like this:

> **Subject**: Your Norton 360 Subscription Has Expired — Action Required  
> **Body**: We were unable to process your auto-renewal. Please call us at 1-800-XXXXXXX to update your payment method and avoid interruption.

Once you call, the attacker poses as a tech support rep and:

1. Requests remote access to your device  
2. Asks for credit card or banking details  
3. Installs malware or remote control tools in the background  
4. May trick you into logging into your online banking to “verify a refund”

## Common Variants

- **Emails** faking Norton, McAfee, Microsoft, or PayPal renewal receipts  
- **Browser popups** that freeze your screen and show fake alerts  
- **Phone calls** from scammers pretending to “refund overcharged fees”  
- **Text messages** saying your subscription auto-renewed and a refund is pending  

---

## Why It Works

- Leverages brand recognition (Norton, PayPal, etc.)  
- Creates urgency — “renew now or lose protection”  
- Uses tech jargon to sound legitimate  
- Offers a fake refund to bait you into action  
- Exploits fear of viruses or identity theft

## Real-World Example

A user receives this email:

> Thank you for renewing your McAfee subscription. You have been charged $349.99.  
> If this was a mistake, call us immediately to process a full refund.  
> **1-888-555-XXXX** (24/7 Support)

The phone rep “helps” them install remote access tools and steals banking info during the fake refund process.

## How to Spot It

- You don't actually use the software listed  
- Amounts are unusually high (e.g., $349+)  
- The sender address is random or generic (e.g., `noreply@security-update247.com`)  
- Uses emotional language like “URGENT” or “FINAL NOTICE”  
- Refunds require you to call — real companies never do this  
- Invoices attached as Word or PDF files with generic logos  

---

## How to Stay Safe

- Never call a number listed in an unsolicited invoice  
- If unsure, log in directly to the actual vendor (e.g., Norton.com) — not through the email  
- Don’t install anything or give remote access unless you initiated the request  
- Mark these messages as spam or phishing in your email client  
- Use multi-factor authentication on bank accounts to reduce fraud risk

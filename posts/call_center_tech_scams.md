# Call Center Tech Support Scams — What They Say and Why

These scams involve fake support calls, popups, or voicemails claiming your device is infected or compromised.  
The goal is to scare you into calling a “technician” — who then steals access, data, or money.

## How the Scam Works

It starts with:

- A browser popup that locks your screen and says “Do not close — your computer is infected!”  
- A voicemail claiming to be from Microsoft or Norton support  
- An unsolicited call saying “your system is reporting critical errors”

Once you call back or stay on the line, they:

1. Ask you to download remote control tools (e.g., AnyDesk, TeamViewer)  
2. Show fake “system errors” using built-in tools like Event Viewer or Task Manager  
3. Claim your license expired or your network is compromised  
4. Request payment for a “one-time fix” or multi-year support plan  
5. Sometimes offer a refund, then create a fake “banking over-refund” scenario to steal more

## Where These Scams Show Up

- Fake antivirus popups on shady websites or ads  
- “System scan” overlays that freeze your screen  
- Voicemails saying your subscription is expiring  
- Search engine ads for fake Microsoft or Norton support  
- Robocalls spoofing real company names and numbers  

---

## Why It Works

- Preys on fear of viruses or financial loss  
- Uses technical language to confuse non-technical users  
- Sounds urgent and scripted (“Your system has been flagged for data exfiltration”)  
- Impersonates trusted names like Microsoft, McAfee, or Apple  
- Pushes for quick action to avoid “complete data loss”

## Real-World Example

A popup takes over your browser with the Windows Defender logo and this message:

> **CRITICAL ALERT FROM MICROSOFT**  
> Your computer has been blocked.  
> Call support at 1-888-123-4567 to remove the threat.

When you call, the scammer walks you through downloading remote access software and charges $299 for the “fix.”  
In the background, they may quietly exfiltrate files or install malware.

## How to Spot It

- Real tech companies **never initiate unsolicited support calls**  
- Popups that prevent you from closing the browser are fake  
- Support numbers found in error messages are always fake  
- Fake “Event Viewer” warnings like “Error ID 7001” mean nothing  
- Repeated urging to “act now” is a red flag  
- Any mention of gift cards or wire transfers for payment = scam

---

## How to Stay Safe

- Never call numbers listed in popups or error screens  
- Don’t let strangers remote into your computer — no matter how convincing  
- Close the browser or reboot if you see a suspicious message  
- Run a real antivirus scan after any weird popup or redirect  
- Block known scam numbers and report them to authorities  
- Educate family or older users who are common targets

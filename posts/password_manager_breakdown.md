→ Good managers use **zero knowledge encryption** — even they can’t see your passwords.

❌ “Writing down passwords is just as safe”  
→ Not if someone finds your sticky note. Or your notebook. Or your phone notes.

❌ “I can remember them all”  
→ Can you remember 30+ 16-character complex strings? With symbols?

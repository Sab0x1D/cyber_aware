# Crypto Giveaway Scams — Elon’s Not Sending ETH

These scams promise free cryptocurrency in exchange for a small upfront payment or ask users to “verify” a wallet.  
They often impersonate tech CEOs, crypto platforms, or influencers to appear credible.

## How the Scam Works

You see a message like:

> **Elon Musk is giving away 10,000 ETH!**  
> Send 0.5 ETH to the address below and receive 5 ETH back instantly!

Or:

> **Binance Anniversary Giveaway**  
> Connect your wallet to claim your airdrop.

Once you send funds or connect your wallet:

- You **lose the funds permanently**  
- If you sign a smart contract, scammers can **drain your wallet**  
- Your wallet may be **cloned or phished** for future use

---

## Common Delivery Methods

- YouTube livestreams faking Tesla or SpaceX events  
- Fake Twitter/X replies from verified-looking accounts  
- Email blasts using spoofed addresses (e.g., `noreply@binance-airdrop.com`)  
- Discord, Telegram, or Reddit messages offering free NFTs or giveaways  
- Fake wallet popups on compromised crypto sites  

---

## Why It Works

- Uses celebrity trust (Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, MrBeast, etc.)  
- Plays on greed — “get rich fast” or “limited-time airdrop”  
- Looks legitimate due to branding, logos, and real video footage  
- Fake websites often closely match the real domains  
- Targets users who already own crypto and are used to online promotions

## Real-World Example

A YouTube ad claims Tesla is launching a new crypto.  
The stream shows real Elon Musk interviews, with a “QR code” for viewers to scan and send crypto.

Thousands send funds — **and none receive anything back**.  
The wallet is controlled by the scammer, and transactions are irreversible.

## How to Spot It

- **Anyone asking you to send crypto to get more back is a scam**  
- Giveaways requiring wallet connection or seed phrase input  
- URLs that are slightly off (e.g., `binánce.com` instead of `binance.com`)  
- Streams with chat disabled or flooded with fake praise  
- Overuse of emojis, countdowns, or “only X left” gimmicks  
- Messages from unfamiliar Telegram or Discord groups  

---

## How to Stay Safe

- Never send crypto in response to a giveaway  
- Use wallet browser extensions that detect malicious contracts  
- Bookmark real crypto platforms — don’t rely on ads or messages  
- Double-check official social accounts before trusting any campaign  
- Don’t connect your wallet to unfamiliar dApps or sites  
- Enable withdrawal delays and 2FA on crypto exchange accounts

# “Your Parcel Is Held” Text Messages Explained

These SMS scams claim a package couldn’t be delivered and urge you to click a link.  
Once clicked, the site may steal credentials, credit card info, or prompt malware downloads.

## How the Scam Works

You receive a text message like:

> **Royal Mail: Your parcel is awaiting delivery.**  
> Please confirm your address and pay the £1.99 handling fee: [fake-link.com]

Or:

> **AUPost: Delivery attempt failed.**  
> Reschedule at [short.url/xyz123]

The link leads to a fake parcel tracking site that:

- Looks like the real postal service website  
- Asks you to input name, address, DOB, and card details  
- May install malicious APKs on Android devices  
- Sends data to the attacker in real time

---

## Why It Works

- Everyone orders online — it feels timely and relevant  
- Fake sites look real (logos, tracking bars, forms)  
- Small “fee” sounds harmless, making you more likely to pay  
- Urgency (24-hour delivery window) increases clicks  
- Targets both consumers and business employees

## Real-World Example

A victim receives:

> **DHL: We attempted to deliver your package, but no one was home.**  
> Reschedule now: `dhl-tracking-secure.com`

The user clicks, fills out a fake form, and enters card details.  
Days later, their card is charged with multiple unauthorized purchases.  
On Android, the link also installs spyware that silently monitors messages.

## How to Spot It

- Domain is unfamiliar or slightly altered (e.g., `auspost-track.delivery`)  
- Fee requested for standard delivery or customs is suspicious  
- Shortened links hide the real destination (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)  
- SMS arrives even if you didn’t order anything recently  
- Grammar or formatting errors in the message  
- App download prompt outside of Play Store  

---

## How to Stay Safe

- Never enter payment or personal info via SMS links  
- Always verify delivery status through official tracking portals  
- Report fake parcel texts to your country’s scam watchdog or telco  
- On Android, disable unknown app installs from browsers  
- Use SMS spam filtering tools or block known scam numbers

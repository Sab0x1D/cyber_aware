# 🎣 Phishing Red Flags: How to Spot a Trap

Phishing remains one of the **most successful attack methods** in the world. Why? Because it doesn't rely on hacking systems — it hacks people.

Whether it's through **email**, **SMS**, or even **LinkedIn messages**, attackers rely on a handful of tried-and-true tricks. This blog walks through the **red flags** you should watch for — and how to respond if you spot them.

---

## 1. Urgency or Fear

> “Your account will be suspended in 24 hours.”
>  
> “A login was detected from Russia. Click here to secure your account.”

Attackers want you to **panic and act without thinking**. If an email sounds overly urgent or threatening, stop and question it.

✅ Tip: Real services don’t threaten suspension without prior notice — always log in via a known URL, not the email.

---

## 2. Spelling, Grammar & Tone

Poor spelling, unusual formatting, and awkward phrases are classic signs of phishing — especially when they come from a “professional” source.

Examples:
- “You are require to updated your informations.”
- “Dear valued client we see unauthorized activity.”

✅ Tip: Read slowly. Bad grammar is often the first clue.

---

## 3. Suspicious Links (Hover First!)

Attackers disguise malicious links with text like:

- `Click here to login`
- `https://secure-payments.mybank.com.fakeurl.ru`

✅ Tip: Hover over links before clicking. Do they go to the correct domain? If unsure, open a browser and navigate manually.

---

## 4. Spoofed Senders

The **display name** might say "Microsoft Support" — but the actual email could be `support@microsof-talerts.info`.

✅ Tip: Always check the **actual sender address**. If the domain looks suspicious or unofficial, it probably is.

---

## 5. Unexpected Attachments

A PDF, Word doc, or ZIP file you didn’t request? Dangerous.

Malware often hides in:
- `.docm` or `.xlsm` files (macro-enabled)
- `.js`, `.vbs`, or `.scr` scripts inside ZIPs

✅ Tip: Don’t open attachments you weren’t expecting — even if the sender looks legit. When in doubt, verify.

---

## What to Do If You Suspect Phishing

1. **Don’t click. Don’t reply. Don’t open.**
2. **Report it** to your IT or security team
3. If personal: forward it to `reportphishing@apwg.org` or your mail provider’s abuse team
4. If you clicked: **change your password immediately** and enable MFA if not already on

## Real-World Example

> **Subject:** [Action Required] Office365 Password Expiration Notice  
>  
> Hello,  
> Your password will expire in 12 hours.  
>  
> To maintain access, please verify your credentials here:  
> `https://office365support-authenticate.net/login`  
>  
> - IT Admin

👀 Red Flags:
- Non-Microsoft domain  
- Unusual urgency  
- Generic sign-off  
- You weren’t expecting a password reset

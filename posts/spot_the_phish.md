## 5 Red Flags in Under a Minute

### 1. Urgency = Manipulation

> “Verify now or your email will be deleted.”

- Designed to **panic** you
- Often uses **countdowns**, threats, or warnings

✅ **Pause**, don’t react immediately

---

### 2. Who Really Sent It?

- Display name: `Apple Support`
- Actual sender: `alert@apple-pay-fraud.cc`

✅ Hover or expand the sender to check the real domain

---

### 3. Grammar That’s... Off

- “You are to update your informations.”
- “Congratulation! Your account has won a iPhone.”

✅ Bad English = Big Red Flag  
(Professional orgs rarely make basic errors)

---

### 4. Hover Before You Click

    Link text:    Reset your account
    Real URL:     https://login.security-alert-microsoft[.]com

✅ Hover first → Do **not** trust the label alone

---

### 5. Attachments Out of Nowhere?

| File Type | Risk Level     | Common Payloads              |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| `.docm`   | ⚠️ High         | Macro malware, stealers      |
| `.zip`    | ⚠️ High         | Embedded scripts             |
| `.exe`    | 🚫 Critical     | Direct malware executables   |

✅ If you didn’t request it — **don’t open it**

---

## What You Should Do

🛑 **STOP** – Don’t click, reply, or download anything  
📤 **REPORT** – Send it to IT/security team (or spam/phish tools)  
🔐 **CHANGE PASSWORDS** – If you clicked or entered anything  
📱 **ENABLE MFA** – Protects you even if creds leak

---

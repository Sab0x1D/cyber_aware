# QR Codes in Public Spaces — Tap to Get Hacked?

QR codes are everywhere — restaurant menus, event posters, parking meters, even café loyalty programs.  
But that convenience comes at a cost: **QR code abuse is now a serious threat vector**, especially in phishing and malware campaigns.

This post explores how attackers weaponize QR codes and how to safely interact with them in public.

## The Problem: Blind Trust in QR Codes

Most users scan a QR code without thinking — assuming it leads to:

- A menu  
- A Wi-Fi login  
- A payment portal  
- An official app page  

But attackers have realized this blind trust is a perfect entry point.

## How QR Code Attacks Work

### 1. **QR Phishing (Quishing)**

A malicious QR code leads to:

- A fake login page (Office365, Instagram, PayPal)  
- A download for a malicious app or APK  
- A crypto scam or payment site  

### 2. **Malware Distribution**

If scanned on Android, the QR might link to:

- Direct APK file download (bypasses Play Store)  
- Website that asks for dangerous permissions  
- Exploit delivery using browser vulnerabilities  

### 3. **Payment Fraud**

- QR stickers placed over legitimate ones at parking machines or donations  
- Scans lead to attacker-controlled payment accounts  
- No refund possible — payments are instant and final

## Real-World Example

A QR code was found posted over an EV charging station in a major city:

> “Scan to pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay”

Victims scanned, entered payment info, and never saw the payment go through.  
The site was a phishing page — the attacker collected credit card details and reused them within hours.

# Common Phone Scams & What to Say

Vishing (voice phishing) involves **phone calls designed to trick you** into sharing information, sending money, or granting access to systems.

Unlike smishing, vishing is **interactive** — scammers use pressure, confusion, and social engineering to manipulate people in real time.

This post outlines the most common types of scam calls and provides **safe response templates** you can use.

## Common Phone Scam Types

### 1. **Tech Support Scams**

> “We’ve detected a virus on your computer. I’m calling from Microsoft/Apple. Please install this software so I can help.”

They walk the victim through installing remote access tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk, then “fix” fake problems — often asking for payment at the end.

**Say This Instead:**

> “Thanks for the call, but I don’t take unsolicited support calls. I’ll contact support through the official website if needed.”

### 2. **Government or Law Enforcement Scams**

> “This is the ATO/IRS. There’s a warrant for your arrest unless you pay today.”

Relies on **fear and urgency**.  
They often spoof official phone numbers and demand gift card or crypto payments.

**Say This Instead:**

> “I’ll call back through the number listed on your official website.”

### 3. **Bank Fraud Department**

> “There’s suspicious activity on your card. To verify your identity, please confirm your account number and PIN.”

Sometimes they'll follow up with a **fake verification SMS** to make it seem real.

**Say This Instead:**

> “I’m ending this call and contacting my bank through the number on my card.”

### 4. **Voicemail Callback Traps**

You get a missed call or voicemail saying:

> “Your PayPal transaction for $899 was approved. Call now if this wasn’t you.”

Calling back connects you to a scammer posing as “fraud support,” often leading to remote access or payment scams.

**Best Practice:**

Don’t call back numbers from voicemails unless you're expecting the call.  
Check your actual PayPal/Bank app or log in directly.
